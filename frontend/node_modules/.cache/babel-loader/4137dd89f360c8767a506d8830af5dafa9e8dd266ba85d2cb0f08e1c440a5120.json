Some of the most well-known literary movements include Romanticism, Realism, Naturalism, Modernism, and Postmodernism. Romanticism, for example, emphasized emotion, individualism, and the beauty of nature, while Realism sought to depict the world as it really is, often with a focus on the lives of ordinary people. Naturalism, on the other hand, portrayed humans as being shaped by their environment and biology, while Modernism and Postmodernism explored new forms of expression and challenged traditional notions of narrative and authorship.
